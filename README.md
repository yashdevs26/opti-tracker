# Opti-Tracker - A Simple Yet Efficient Activity, and Task Logging App (POC)

Opti-Tracker is a Proof of Concept (POC) developed as part of a portfolio project initiative to gain hands-on experience with the latest Spring Boot ecosystem and AWS services.

This application utilizes the latest version of the Spring Boot framework to construct a REST API, with Spring Data JPA for managing database instances and Spring Security for securing the application using JWT tokenization. The Java Mail API is integrated for user validation and registration, ensuring proper access configuration for app usage. The app is deployed on AWS, leveraging services such as Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, S3, and RDS, which provided valuable insights into core AWS features.

Currently, the app supports basic task logging, with the primary focus on creating a solid skeleton with attention to REST API functionality. In the next phase (v1.1), enhancements will include parameters such as timestamps, dates, task status, and graphical reports to improve the usability experience. Additionally, the inclusion of Activities and Goals will allow for better categorization and tracking of parameters. The long-term goal is to integrate a finance and budget tracker, leveraging microservices to effectively track cash flow.
